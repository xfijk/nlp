The highest line in the first plot presents the classification of logistic regression. The accuracy starts 0.7157867495 with the threshold 0.05. The accuracy increases with the larger threshold. The accuracy increases up to 0.74 when the threshold is 0.5 and the accuracy is finally robust around 0.74 after the threshold is larger than 0.6. The LinearSVC classification does not perform as well as the logistic regression. The accuracy starts 0.633747412. The accuracy increases faster than the logistic regression between the treshold 0.05 and 0.4. The accuracy of the LinearSVC at the threshold 0.4 is 0.680952381, and the threshold increases slowly after the threshold 0.4. The GussionNB classification performs the worst compared to the other two classification for any threshold we set.
